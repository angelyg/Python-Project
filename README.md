# Python-Project
This is a virtual piano/keyboard made with Python coding.

How this project works is quite simple: for every key that is pressed on the keyboard, a different note will play.This code is based off of an actual piano, but the notes may not be exact. 

This repository contains a minimal code to play on your computer keyboard like if it was a piano
