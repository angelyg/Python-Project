# Python-Project

This repository contains a minimal code to play on your computer keyboard like if it was a piano.
This is a virtual piano/keyboard made with Python coding.

How this project works is quite simple: for every key that is pressed on the keyboard, a different note will play. This code was made to mimick a piano/keyboard, but the notes are not exact.
